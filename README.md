# React Task App

Built as part of [The Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails?) curriculum: [JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript) course.

This React app allows a user to create their CV with three sections:

- General information
- Educational experience
- Practical experience (work)

Multiple educational or work experiences can be added and edited independently.

## Techniques Implemented

- Class-based components
- Type checking using TypeScript
- Passing props between components
- Storing multiple instances of components and allowing independent editing
- Styling using Sass

## Improvement Ideas

- Implement modal to confirm deletion of a Work or Education section
- Allow user to export CV to PDF file
